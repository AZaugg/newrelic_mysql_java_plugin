MySQL Metric Categories
 
The New Relic plugin is an extensible architecture, allowing you to define your
own new MySQL metrics that can be obtained via an SQL statement.  As new MySQL 
versions are released, or with additional MySQL third-party storage engines 
addtional information is available for gathering and instrumenting.

Providing an SQL statement can return either a set of rows of key/value results,
or return a single row of many columns with a single value, and those values are 
numeric (a New Relic limitation), the MySQL plugin can record this information 
in New Relic.

The config/metric.category.json file includes the default categories of MySQL metrics
and provides some additional examples for reference.

The obvious commands SHOW GLOBAL STATUS, SHOW MASTER STATUS and SHOW SLAVE STATUS 
satisfy the previous formatting requirements. Additionally commands that select
information from the INFORMATION_SCHEMA, PERFORMANCE_SCHEMA or other tables are possible,
for example in MySQL 5.5 SELECT * FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.innodb_buffer_pool_stats and
in MySQL 5.6 SELECT name, count FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.innodb_metrics provide additional
information. 

Commands such as SHOW ENGINE INNODB STATUS and SHOW ENGINE INNODB MUTEX are not 
currently supported because they do not fall into the above two categories.

The "metrics" configuration for each MySQL Instance is a CSV list of metric categories 
that are collected for each MySQL Instance.
