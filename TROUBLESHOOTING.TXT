Empty Graphs
------------

By default, New Relic captures only "status" and "newrelic" category information. Certain graphs use
different categories to public metrics.

Some categories are not applicable, and are therefore not included by default. For example "slave" is 
only applicable on MySQL slaves, "innodb_status" is only applicable for environments that use the InnoDB 
storage engine.


For example, if the Innodb History List Length is empty, then "innodb_status" is necessary.
